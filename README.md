# final-project

I am using data from NOAA: http://ccma.nos.noaa.gov/ecosystems/sanctuaries/stellwagen_nms/ 
this would be intersting to look at becaus eof the greenland ice sheets melting and the fresh water being distributed into the gulf of mexico through currents 
Arctic Sea Ice Concentration and Extent from Danish Meteorological Institute Sea Ice Charts, 1901-1956

I will be able to show how the greenland ice sheets are directly effecting salinity. I plan on doing this by creating a graphic compairing the data sets through jupyter lab and panda. I'd manipulate the data set by compairing the two data set, I'd visualize the data sets through panda
